This is a simple program to look for flash files that are currently
being streamed in a browser/plugin-container but have been deleted from
the filesystem.

It makes use of the /proc/pid/fd directory to look for such files and
then open them so you can get access to the streams.

e.g

     $ ./find.flv
     Process 7343 is a plugin-containe
     [7343]  /tmp/FlashXXlP0Rue (deleted)
     Opened /proc/7497/fd/5

You can then copy the file /proc/7497/fd/5 to someplace else (once the
stream has finished) to have a copy of it.
